  abstract    = {Building on the methodological foundations of the U.S. Opportunity Atlas, we
explore the relationship between childhood circumstances and human capital outcomes
between birth and adulthood. We use dozens of administrative data sets to track
the Dutch population, consisting of 17 million individuals, and link children to their
parents.
We develop some refinements of the methods used by the U.S. Opportunity Atlas
to better estimate absolute mobility at given percentiles of the parental income distri-
bution and demonstrate that the adoption of narrow parental income bandwidths and
flexible econometric specifications reduce systematic biases.
The descriptive analysis of KansenKaart, or Netherlands Childhood Opportunity
Maps, can be organized into three parts: (1) we analyze intergenerational mobility
gradients between parents and children in the Netherlands and find that, on average,
a 1 percentile increase in parent income is associated with a 0.283 percentile increase
in child income, (2) we present spatial variation in intergenerational mobility in the
Netherlands, as shown on our interactive website kansenkaart.nl. The KansenKaart
reveals substantial differences in upward mobility across municipalities and neighbor-
hoods, conditional on parental income. For example, the gender wage and education
gap correlate most strongly with the proportion of orthodox Christian residents in
areas, and (3) we correlate the estimates of intergenerational mobility at the local
level with a rich set of municipality characteristics, such as family structure, politi-
cal preferences, and the share of immigrants. This provides insights into which local
characteristics are associated with high upward intergenerational mobility.
Our findings show significant variation in childhood opportunities in the Nether-
lands, even in this seemingly egalitarian country

  title       = {Improved Targeting to Prevent Adverse Birth Outcomes Using Big Data in the Netherlands},
  year        = {2025},
  type        = {Working Paper},
  bibtex_show = true,
  abstract    = {A strong association has been documented between adverse birth outcomes and 
  compromised health from early childhood to adulthood. Hence, policymakers may consider targeting 
  their policies toward specific geographic areas and demographic groups with a high incidence of 
  adverse birth outcomes. In this paper, we document the association between adverse birth outcomes 
  and a wide range of sociodemographic circumstances by linking the universe of all 1,558,979 births 
  in the Netherlands between 2011 and 2020 to administrative data on home addresses, household incomes, 
  and migration backgrounds of parents. We present three sets of results. First, birth outcomes in the
   Netherlands vary substantially by parental income: 18.6 percent of low-income births are small for 
   gestational age (SGA) versus 8.4 percent of high-income births; 8.4 percent of low-income births are 
   preterm versus 5.6 percent of high-income births; and the infant mortality rate is 1.3 percent among 
   low-income births versus 0.4 percent among high-income births. Second, we observe substantial geographic 
   variation in birth outcomes among low-income parents, defined as parents with an income at the 25th 
   percentile of the parental income distribution, or € 52,749. When compared to low-income parents 
   in the geographic center of the Netherlands, parents with a similar income in the former mining 
   zone in the southeast of the Netherlands were twice as likely to experience SGA births (18.4 percent
    versus 8.9 percent, respectively), 1.8 times more likely to experience preterm births (10.3 percent
     versus 5.8 percent), and 2.8 times more likely to face infant mortality (1.04 percent versus 0.37 
     percent). Third, areas where low-income parents are more likely to experience adverse birth outcomes
      are characterized by relatively large shares of Roman Catholic and Muslim, but not Protestant Christian,
       residents; large shares of residents with an immigrant background; and large vote shares for two 
       populist parties on the left and the right of the political spectrum. Controlling for parental income,
        strong geographic variation in birth outcomes persists in the Netherlands. We have developed two 
        publicly available interactive websites to help policymakers and health professionals in targeting 
        these policies and interventions in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have compiled a publicly 
        available dataset that can be used by other researchers to examine the determinants of adverse 
        birth outcomes.

  type        = {Working Paper},
  bibtex_show = true,
  abstract    = {The earliest years of a child's life have gained significant attention from policymakers when designing 
  policies to improve children's well-being. While the evidence clearly shows that adverse birth outcomes negatively 
  impact long-term outcomes in adulthood, the literature remains uncertain whether these negative effects start as 
  early as age 2. In this paper, I examine whether low birth weight (< 2,500 g) and preterm birth (< 37 weeks)
   are associated with a higher risk of being underweight or overweight, experiencing speech and language delays, or 
   requiring youth protection services by age 2. My analysis uses comprehensive, large-scale data from the Netherlands,
    covering the period between 2010 and 2018. The primary data source is Preventive Youth Health Care, merged with 
    administrative data from Statistics Netherlands. I conduct an empirical analysis using a mother fixed-effects 
    regression model with a range of control variables. After adjusting for these control variables, including 
    mother-fixed effects, low birth weight is associated with a 7.8 percentage point increase in the likelihood 
    of being underweight. Conversely, high birth weight (> 4,000 g) is associated with a 10.5 percentage point
     increase in the likelihood of being overweight. The associations between birth weight and indicators of speech 
     and language development disappear entirely after adjusting for confounders. The association between low birth weight
      and the use of youth protection services is significantly reduced after controlling for mother-fixed effects,
       although a small but significant association remains (0.272 percentage points). Similar conclusions apply to
        preterm birth. Interventions aimed at preventing both low and high birth weight may improve children’s health 
        and development by age 2, as significant effects are seen for body weight and youth protection services use. 
        However, these interventions do not appear to improve speech and language development outcomes. In the future,
         I will also test these results for robustness using twin fixed effects and examine outcomes measured later 
         in age 2 to determine whether these results persist or change beyond this age. Additionally, I will explore
          other outcomes, such as healthcare costs.
