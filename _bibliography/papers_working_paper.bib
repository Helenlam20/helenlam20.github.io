  abstract    = {Building on the methodological foundations of the U.S. Opportunity Atlas, we
explore the relationship between childhood circumstances and human capital outcomes
between birth and adulthood. We use dozens of administrative data sets to track
the Dutch population, consisting of 17 million individuals, and link children to their
parents.
We develop some refinements of the methods used by the U.S. Opportunity Atlas
to better estimate absolute mobility at given percentiles of the parental income distri-
bution and demonstrate that the adoption of narrow parental income bandwidths and
flexible econometric specifications reduce systematic biases.
The descriptive analysis of KansenKaart, or Netherlands Childhood Opportunity
Maps, can be organized into three parts: (1) we analyze intergenerational mobility
gradients between parents and children in the Netherlands and find that, on average,
a 10 percentile increase in parent income is associated with a 2.83 percentile increase
in child income, (2) we present spatial variation in intergenerational mobility in the
Netherlands, as shown on our interactive website kansenkaart.nl. The KansenKaart
reveals substantial differences in upward mobility across municipalities and neighbor-
hoods, conditional on parental income, and
(3) we correlate the estimates of intergenerational mobility at the local level with a
rich set of municipality characteristics, such as family structure, political preferences,
and the share of immigrants. This provides insights into which local characteristics are
associated with high upward intergenerational mobility.
Our findings show significant variation in childhood opportunities in the Nether-
lands, even in this seemingly egalitarian country.
