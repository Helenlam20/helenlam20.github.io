The main project I have worked on for three years as a junior researcher is the “KansenKaart” project, which is the Dutch version of the American Opportunity Atlas, inspired by the work of Chetty et al. (2014). The KansenKaart is a project on intergenerational mobility across areas in the Netherlands. The aim is to show how circumstances in which Dutch children grow up are associated with later-life outcomes. The KansenKaart analyses can be organized into three parts. 

## Gradients
In the first part, we begin by analyzing intergenerational mobility gradients between parents and children in the Netherlands. We expand our analysis with additional child outcomes that measure intergenerational mobility as well as additional socioeconomic characteristics of children, parents’ characteristics, such as income, wealth, educational attainment, and migration background, and geographic locations within the Netherlands. The goal is to provide insight into the development of inequalities from birth to adulthood. We will disseminate these results to the general public through a user-friendly interface on kansenkloof.nl. An early prototype can be found on [ongelijkheidincijfers.amsterdam](ongelijkheidincijfers.amsterdam).

## Opportunity maps
In the second part, we present spatial variation in intergenerational mobility in the Netherlands. These results are shown on [kansenkaart.nl](kansenkaart.nl). The KansenKaart (Opportunity Map in English) shows substantial differences in upward mobility between municipalities and neighborhoods, conditional on parental income. An overall pattern on these maps is that urban areas and areas in Northeastern Netherlands tend to have lower rates of upward mobility compared to rural areas. Moreover, there are substantial differences in the upward socioeconomic mobility between men and women in regions with a high share of Dutch Reformed inhabitants’ areas. For example, women who grew up in these regions have on average substantially lower hourly wages than men.

## Correlates
A question that naturally arises is why some areas in the Netherlands have higher rates of upward intergenerational mobility than other areas. In the third part, we correlate the estimates of intergenerational mobility at the local level with a rich set of municipality characteristics, such as family structure, political preferences, and the share of immigrants. This provides insights into the question of which local characteristics are associated with high upward intergenerational mobility. 

## Future plans
Currently, we are working on two research papers derived from the KansenKaart, which will form part of my dissertation. The first paper describes the methods, applied to the association between child income and parents’ income. In this paper, we discuss the key differences between the statistical methods used by Chetty et al. (2014) and our methods used on the KansenKaart, where we allow for more flexibility in the relationship between parents’ income and child outcomes and show how incorrect functional form assumptions about the relationship between child income and parents’ income at the local level may bias results. The second paper presents our results on adverse birth outcomes: small-for-gestational age, preterm birth, and infant mortality.
