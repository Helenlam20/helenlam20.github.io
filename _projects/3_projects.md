#### Abstract

**Objective** To examine whether low birth weight and preterm birth are associated with an increased risk of being underweight or overweight, the speech and language delay, or the use of youth protection services at age 2.

**Background** The earliest years of a child’s life have become a topic of interest among poli- cymakers when developing various policies, which aim to improve the children’s well-being. However, it is unclear from the literature whether lowering the number of low birth weights and preterm births are effective in improving child health and development at age 2.

**Data** Large-scale comprehensive data ranging over the period between 2010 and 2018 from the Netherlands is used for the empirical analysis. This data covers 4 out of the 41 regions in the Netherlands. The Preventive Youth Health Care collects the primary source of information.

**Methods** The empirical analysis relies on an Ordinary Least Squares regression model with mother fixed effects and a set of controls.

**Findings** After controlling for a rich set of controls, including the mother fixed effects, low birth weight (< 2,500 g) is positively associated with being underweight (7.8 percentage points), while high birth weight (≥ 4,000 g) is positively associated with being overweight (10.5 per- centage points). On the other hand, the associations between birth weight, and the speech and language development indicators completely disappear after controlling for confounders. The association between low birth weight and the use of youth protection services diminishes substantially after controlling for mother fixed effects, although a small but significant associa- tion remains (0.272 percentage points). Similar conclusions can be drawn from the results regarding gestational age.

**Conclusion** Interventions that prevent both prevent low and high birth weight among children may improve their health and development as significant results are documented for Body Mass Index and youth protection services. However, it does not appear to improve their speech and language development.
