I am a first-year PhD candidate at the School of Health Policy and Management (Health Economics) at Erasmus University Rotterdam. My PhD is funded by the Health Equity action line of the Erasmus initiative <i>Smarter Choices for Beter Health.</i>

My research interests are in the field of health economics and applied microeconomics, with a particular emphasis on human capital, child health and development, and socioeconomic inequality in early childhood. 

Currently, I am working on three research projects:

**1) KansenKaart project: intergenerational mobility in the Netherlands.**

In this project, we investigate intergenerational mobility across different regions in the Netherlands. Using the U.S. Opportunity Atlas as our methodological foundation, we explore the relationship between childhood circumstances and human capital outcomes from birth to adulthood.

<!-- We develop some refinements of the methods used by the U.S. Opportunity Atlas
to better estimate absolute mobility at given percentiles of the parental income distribution and demonstrate that the adoption of narrow parental income bandwidths and
flexible econometric specifications reduce systematic biases. -->

**2) Birth Inequalities: The Effect of Adverse Birth Outcomes on Child Health and Development at Age 2.**

 In this project, my focus is on the relationship between birth outcomes and health and development in early childhood. Specifically, I examine the association between two birth outcomes, low birth weight, and preterm birth, and an increased risk of being underweight or overweight, speech and language delay, and the use of youth protection services at age 2.

**3) The Social and Economic Impact of Housing Market Policy in the Netherlands: What can we learn from bank transaction data?**

This is a new project that I have just started, and it is more focused on the area of applied and general economics. Using bank transaction data, we aim to study the socioeconomic changes for residents in neighborhoods with relatively low-income households where new houses will be built to attract high-income households.
